Taking a list can help – you can even just hand it over to the doctor or nurse.<br>2: Having a trusted person with you can help. You have the right to see the doctor or nurse in private or have someone else with you.<br><br>‍<strong>During the visit<br>‍</strong>Remember you can ask questions. If you’re not sure what the doctor or nurse is saying, ask them. If they don’t get what you’re saying, talk with them some more about why you have come.
